<h3>
  Richard Feynman Quotes
“You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world,
 but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever 
 about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places,
  and what they call the bird… I learned very early the difference between
   knowing the name of something and knowing something.”

<H4>
Following the establishment of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics,
 an initial relativistic theory was formulated for the interaction between 
 charged particles and electromagnetic fields. This needed to be reformulated,
  however. In 1948 in particular, Richard Feynman contributed to creating a 
  new quantum electrodynamics by introducing Feynman diagrams: 
  graphic representations of various interactions between different particles. 
  These diagrams facilitate the calculation of interaction probabilities.
